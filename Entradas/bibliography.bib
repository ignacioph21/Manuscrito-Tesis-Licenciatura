Capillary waves are excited in a spherical container partially filled with water and undergoing sinusoidal or random oscillations. The fluctuations of the interface, recorded with two capacitive probes are analyzed by means of the frequency power spectrum of wave elevation. For high enough forcing amplitudes, we report power-law spectra with exponents close to the prediction of weak wave turbulence theory. However, in this experiment the free-surface steepness is not small compared to 1 and thus the investigated regimes correspond to strongly nonlinear wave turbulence.},

  abstract = {The nonlinear dynamics of waves at the sea surface is believed to be ruled by the Weak Turbulence framework. In order to investigate the nonlinear coupling among gravity surface waves, we developed an experiment in the Coriolis facility which is a 13-m diameter circular tank. An isotropic and statistically stationary wave turbulence of average steepness of 10\textbackslash\% is maintained by two wedge wave makers. The space and time resolved wave elevation is measured using a stereoscopic technique. Wave-wave interactions are analyzed through third and fourth order correlations. We investigate specifically the role of bound waves generated by non resonant 3-wave coupling. Specifically, we implement a space-time filter to separate the dynamics of free waves (i.e. following the dispersion relation) from the bound waves. We observe that the free wave dynamics causes weak resonant 4-wave correlations. A weak level of correlation is actually the basis of the Weak Turbulence Theory. Thus our observations support the use of the Weak Turbulence to model gravity wave turbulence as is currently been done in the operational models of wave forecasting. Although in the theory bound waves are not supposed to contribute to the energy cascade, our observation raises the question of the impact of bound waves on dissipation and thus on energy transfers as well.},

Surface waves are forced at an intermediate scale corresponding to the gravity-capillary wavelength. In response to this forcing, waves at larger scales are observed. The spectrum of their amplitudes exhibits a frequency-power law at high enough forcing. Both observations are ascribed to the upscale wave action transfers of gravity wave turbulence. The spectrum exponent is close to the value predicted by the weak turbulence theory. The spectrum amplitude is found to scale linearly with the mean injected power. We measure also the distributions of the injected power fluctuations in the presence of upscale (inverse) transfers or in the presence of a downscale (direct) cascade in gravity wave turbulence.},

Many deal with water waves, as modeling of ocean waves has historically motivated the development of weak turbulence theory, which addresses the dynamics of a random ensemble of weakly nonlinear waves in interaction. Recent advances in experiments have shown that this theoretical picture is too idealized to capture experimental observations. While gravity dominates much of the oceanic spectrum, waves observed in the laboratory are in fact gravity--capillary waves, due to the restricted size of wave basins. This richer physics induces many interleaved physical effects far beyond the theoretical framework, notably in the vicinity of the gravity--capillary crossover. These include dissipation, finite--system size effects, and finite nonlinearity effects. Simultaneous space-and-time-resolved techniques, now available, open the way for a much more advanced analysis of these effects.},

A total of 47 intervals of elevated wave state were recorded: 29 exceeding 1 m significant wave height (SWH), 16 exceeding 2 m SWH, and 3 m exceeded on two occasions; during one of those, a SWH of 4 m was observed. Detailed analysis of the two large events, including comparison with high-resolution reanalysis wind data (North America Regional Reanalysis), showed wave direction from the east, varied about 15{$^\circ$} to the north (counterclockwise) from the wind direction, and current flow in the opposite direction (from the west). This is thought to be the influence of a strong ``wind-sea'' presence. Regarding classic wave limitations, although the SE Chukchi Sea is a large embayment bordered by land to the east, fetch limitations from the northeast and southeast did not appear to be a constraint for the wind speeds indicated by reanalysis. These two events appeared to be driven by winds associated with cyclonic systems that moved into the eastern Bering Sea and stalled. Examination of smaller waves associated with these events suggested that waves of 1.5 m SWH or less are likely part of another regime and can either be swell or wind-sea, moving in from the open Chukchi Sea to the northwest or through the Bering Strait to the south.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The control of matter motion at liquid--gas interfaces opens an opportunity to create two-dimensional materials with remotely tunable properties. In analogy with optical lattices used in ultra-cold atom physics, such materials can be created by a wave field capable of dynamically guiding matter into periodic spatial structures. Here we show experimentally that such structures can be realized at the macroscopic scale on a liquid surface by using rotating waves. The wave angular momentum is transferred to floating micro-particles, guiding them along closed trajectories. These orbits form stable spatially periodic patterns, the unit cells of a two-dimensional wave-based material. Such dynamic patterns, a mirror image of the concept of metamaterials, are scalable and biocompatible. They can be used in assembly applications, conversion of wave energy into mean two-dimensional flows and for organising motion of active swimmers.},

  abstract = {A century ago, Lewis Fry Richardson introduced the concept of energy cascades in turbulence. Since this conceptual breakthrough, turbulence has been studied in diverse systems and our knowledge has increased considerably through theoretical, numerical, experimental and observational advances. Eddy turbulence and wave turbulence are the two regimes we can find in nature. So far, most attention has been devoted to the former regime, eddy turbulence, which is often observed in water. However, physicists are often interested in systems for which wave turbulence is relevant. This textbook deals with wave turbulence and systems composed of a sea of weak waves interacting non-linearly. After a general introduction which includes a brief history of the field, the theory of wave turbulence is introduced rigorously for surface waves. The theory is then applied to examples in hydrodynamics, plasma physics, astrophysics and cosmology, giving the reader a modern and interdisciplinary view of the subject.},

This case is characterized by a rather high degree of nonlinearity and a complicated dispersion law. The absence of scale invariance makes this and some other problems of wave turbulence (e.g. nonlinear inertia-gravity waves) intractable by small-perturbation techniques, even in the weak-turbulence limit. The analytical solution obtained in the present work for an arbitrary degree of nonlinearity is shown to be in reasonable agreement with experimental data. The theory explains the dependence of the wave spectrum on wind input and describes the accelerated roll-off of the spectral density function in the narrow sub-range separating scale-invariant regimes of purely gravity and capillary waves, while the appropriate (long- and short-wave) limits yield power laws corresponding to the Zakharov-Filonenko and Phillips spectra.},

The equations for both models were solved using periodic grids with up to \$2048\textasciicircum 2\$ points. In all simulations, the Froude number varies between \$0.015\$ and \$0.05\$, while the Reynolds number and level of dispersion are varied in a broader range to span different regimes. In all cases, most of the energy in the system remains in the waves, even after integrating the system for very long times. For shallow flows, non-linear waves are non-dispersive and the spectrum of potential energy is compatible with \$\textbackslash sim k\textasciicircum\textbraceleft -2\textbraceright\$ scaling. For deeper (Boussinesq) flows, the non-linear dispersion relation as directly measured from the wave and frequency spectrum (calculated independently) shows signatures of dispersion, and the spectrum of potential energy is compatible with predictions of weak turbulence theory, \$\textbackslash sim k\textasciicircum\textbraceleft -4/3\textbraceright\$. In this latter case, the non-linear dispersion relation differs from the linear one and has two branches, which we explain with a simple qualitative argument. Finally, we study probability density functions of the surface height and find that in all cases the distributions are asymmetric. The probability density function can be approximated by a skewed normal distribution as well as by a Tayfun distribution.},

Nevertheless the peak amplitude of the resonant wave was found to increase with distance in very nearly the manner predicted.             These experiments were carried out in 1961 but publication was deferred pending a similar but more accurate investigation by McGoldrick, Phillips, Huang \& Hodgson (1966).

  abstract = {In this work we consider the problem of finding the simplest arrangement of resonant deepwater gravity waves in one-dimensional propagation, from three perspectives: Theoretical, numerical and experimental. Theoretically this requires using a normal-form Hamiltonian that focuses on 5-wave resonances. The simplest arrangement is based on a triad of wavevectors K1 + K2 = K3 (satisfying specific ratios) along with their negatives, corresponding to a scenario of encountering wavepackets, amenable to experiments and numerical simulations. The normal-form equations for these encountering waves in resonance are shown to be non-integrable, but they admit an integrable reduction in a symmetric configuration. Numerical simulations of the governing equations in natural variables using pseudospectral methods require the inclusion of up to 6-wave interactions, which imposes a strong dealiasing cut-off in order to properly resolve the evolving waves. We study the resonance numerically by looking at a target mode in the base triad and showing that the energy transfer to this mode is more efficient when the system is close to satisfying the resonant conditions. We first look at encountering plane waves with base frequencies in the range 1.32--2.35 Hz and steepnesses below 0.1, and show that the time evolution of the target mode's energy is dramatically changed at the resonance. We then look at a scenario that is closer to experiments: Encountering wavepackets in a 400-m long numerical tank, where the interaction time is reduced with respect to the plane-wave case but the resonance is still observed; by mimicking a probe measurement of surface elevation we obtain efficiencies of up to 10\% in frequency space after including near-resonant contributions. Finally, we perform preliminary experiments of encountering wavepackets in a 35-m long tank, which seem to show that the resonance exists physically. The measured efficiencies via probe measurements of surface elevation are relatively small, indicating that a finer search is needed along with longer wave flumes with much larger amplitudes and lower frequency waves. A further analysis of phases generated from probe data via the analytic signal approach (using the Hilbert transform) shows a strong triad phase synchronisation at the resonance, thus providing independent experimental evidence of the resonance.},

Wave Turbulence (WT) is a theory derived for describing statistics of weakly nonlinear waves in the infinite basin limit. Its formal applicability condition on the minimal size of the computational basin is impossible to satisfy in present numerical simulations, and the number of wave resonances is significantly depleted due to the wavenumber discreteness. The goal of this paper will be to examine which WT predictions survive in such discrete systems with depleted resonances and which properties arise specifically due to the discreteness effects. As in [1--3], our results for the wave spectrum agree with the Zakharov-Filonenko spectrum predicted within WT. We also go beyond finding the spectra and compute probability density function (PDF) of the wave amplitudes and observe an anomalously large, with respect to Gaussian, probability of strong waves which is consistent with recent theory [4, 5]. Using a simple model for quasi-resonances we predict an effect arising purely due to discreteness: existence of a threshold wave intensity above which turbulent cascade develops and proceeds to arbitrarily small scales. Numerically, we observe that the energy cascade is very ``bursty'' in time and is somewhat similar to sporadic sandpile avalanches. We explain this as a cycle: a cascade arrest due to discreteness leads to accumulation of energy near the forcing scale which, in turn, leads to widening of the nonlinear resonance and, therefore, triggering of the cascade draining the turbulence levels and returning the system to the beginning of the cycle.},

Two mutually-orthogonal primary wave trains are generated in a tank and their interaction products studied at various positions on the surface. Under suitable conditions, the growing resonant third-order interaction product is identified; its amplitude is shown to be a linear function of the interaction distance. The band-width of the response decreases with increasing distance, as is characteristic of the phenomenon of resonance. The ratio of the frequencies of the primary waves at resonance is very close to that predicted theoretically; the growth rate of the third component is close to, though about 20\% higher than, the predicted value. Conditions far from resonance are also studied; it is found that the growing tertiary wave is absent in this case.             These results offer the first unambiguous experimental demonstration of resonant wave interactions.},

  abstract = {We report numerical investigations of wave turbulence in a vibrating plate. The possibility to implement advanced measurement techniques and long time numerical simulations makes this system extremely valuable for wave turbulence studies. The purely 2D character of dynamics of the elastic plate makes it much simpler to handle compared to much more complex 3D physical systems that are typical of geo- and astrophysical issues (ocean surface or internal waves, magnetized plasmas or strongly rotating and/or stratified flows). When the forcing is small the observed wave turbulence is consistent with the predictions of the Weak Turbulent Theory. Here we focus on the case of stronger forcing for which coherent structures can be observed. These structures look similar to the folds and D-cones that are commonly observed for strongly deformed static thin elastic sheets (crumpled paper) except that they evolve dynamically in our forced system. We describe their evolution and show that their emergence is associated with statistical intermittency (lack of self similarity) of strongly nonlinear wave turbulence. This behavior is reminiscent of intermittency in Navier-Stokes turbulence. Experimental data show hints of the weak to strong turbulence transition. However, due to technical limitations and dissipation, the strong nonlinear regime remains out of reach of experiments and therefore has been explored numerically.},

As the flow velocity is increased, the nonlinear energy transfer generates fluid motion in a broad range of scales forming continuous wave number spectra of the kinetic energy. In isotropic homogeneous incompressible turbulence, energy flux is related to the third-order velocity structure function via the Kolmogorov 4/5 law. In three-dimensional turbulence, the energy is transferred from large to smaller scales in the process of the energy cascade. In two-dimensional turbulence, energy is transferred from smaller to larger scales, the inverse energy cascade. Turbulence greatly increases the rate of mixing in fluids and dispersion. Transport of matter in turbulent flows requires Lagrangian description, in which the observer follows the fluid particles wherever they move. Here, we review the approaches to turbulence description in two and three dimensions.},

For irregular waves, the theoretical distributions of these parameters are not known. Some studies suggest that wave steepness is described well by the Weibull and lognormal probability distributions. These distributions and thus their predictive utility depend on two key statistics, namely the mean and root-mean-square values of wave steepness. This study develops approximate theoretical forms of these statistics for narrow-band long-crested waves. For waves with steepness less than a Miche--Stokes type upper limit, comparisons with measurements from two severe storms show that the theoretical forms so derived and the resulting lognormal law in particular describes empirical data well. These results then permit the distribution of surf parameter to be approximated in a lognormal form also. Consequently, the nature and implications of such an approximation, resulting statistics and their plausible applications to breaker heights and types on slopes are explored.},

The weak turbulence theory is a method for a statistical description of weakly nonlinear interacting waves with random phases. It is not surprising that the theory of weak wave turbulence began to develop in connection with some problems of plasma physics as well as of wind waves. The present review is restricted to one-dimensional wave turbulence, essentially because 4ner computational grids can be used in numerical computations.},
